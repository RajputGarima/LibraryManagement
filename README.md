# LibraryMangement

Built a library management system using HTML, CSS for frontend and PHP, PostgreSQL for backend that runs on localhost. This is basically a database application which deploys huge, real-time DRDO's Defense Science Library data at the backend. <br />

Features of the system:
1. Login
  * as admin
  * as student
2. Search a book
  * by title
  * by author
  * by subject
3. Addition of a new admin by existing admin
4. Add/Edit a member 
5. Extend/cancel membership 
6. Issue book to a member
7. Return book
8. Indent a book
9. Approve indent
10. View transaction history for admin

All the above features run multiple, efficient SQL queries on the huge database to fetch correct results in minimal time. The consistency, integrity of the database is maintained after every transaction. <br />
